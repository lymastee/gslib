Everything from scratch, just for fun

For start:  
Use premake5 to make the project file.  
  
For premake5, pay a visit to:  
[http://premake.github.io/](http://premake.github.io/)  
  
A typical command line was like:  

```
premake5 vs2017
```

Notice:  
These codes were experimentally for now. You may read it for fun, but be ware  
about the risks if you wanted to use them in an actual project.  

For the next:  
Currently I was re-writting the UI system in it.
